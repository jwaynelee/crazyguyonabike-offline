=0.1.3: Charset encoding bug, OSX Application menu & bug fixes=

  * If you used non-ASCII characters in the text (for example, ä or à) then previous versions failed to re-open the file. You'd get something similar to the error box below. This version explicitly saves all files in "UTF-8". Older files are converted automatically so will work seamlessly with this new version.

  * On OSX the Quit, About & Preference actions are now accessed from the specific application menu as shown below.

  * Bug fix
    * NPE when attempting open a journal when another journal is already open. 

=0.1.2: Photo captions, upload selection & bug fixes=

  * If you caption your photos in Picasa (or with similar photo management software) then the caption will be automatically extracted when the photo is added.

  * You can now select one or more pages to upload rather than the entire journal. Your selection must include the _first non-uploaded_ page and be _contiguous_ (you can't skip a page).
